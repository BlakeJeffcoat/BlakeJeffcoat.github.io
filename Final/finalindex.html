                      Street Fighter is a 1987 arcade game developed by Capcom. 
                     It is the first competitive fighting game produced by the 
                     company and the first installment in the Street Fighter 
                     series. It was a commercial success in arcades and introduced
                     special attacks and some of the conventions made standard
                     in later fighting games, such as the six-button controls an
                     d the use of command-based special moves.

                     <p>
                        Street Fighter was directed by Takashi Nishiyama, who conceived
                         it by adapting the boss battles of his earlier beat 'em up game 
                         Kung-Fu Master (1984) for a one-on-one fighting game, and by drawing
                         influence from popular Japanese shōnen manga. A port for the PC
                         Engine/TurboGrafx CD console was released as Fighting Street[b]
                         in 1988, and was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in
                          2009.hi Nishiyama.

                     Its sequel, Street Fighter II (1991), evolved its gameplay 
                  with phenomenal worldwide success. Street Fighter also spawned
                  two spiritual successors, Capcom's beat 'em up Final Fight
                  (working title Street Fighter '89) and SNK's fighting game 
                  Fatal Fury: King of Fighters (1991), the latter designed by

         Staying relevant throughout multiple 
         generations of gaming, Street Fighte
          helped pave the way for such games as 
          Mortal Kombat, Soulcalibur, and Killer
           Instinct. Although Street Fighter was 
           originally produced as an arcade game,
            many titles in the series have been
          released for a variety of gaming platforms,
          including video-game consoles and personal 
           computer systems. In 1994 Street Fighter
             was made into a live-action film
           directed by Steven Souza and 
          starring Jean-Claude Van Damme.
          Although critically panned,
         the movie showcased many of Street
           Fighter’s popular characters.
          A second movie based on the series,
           titled Street Fighter: 
           The Legend of Chun-Li, 
          was released in 2009.

      <p>Street Fighter III is also noteworthy
          for introducing parrying, rewarding
           players for taking the risk of pressing
            forward into an incoming attack
             instead of the standard retreating
              block many were accustomed to. 
              The parry system complemented the
               new Alpha-inspired gauge-based 
               Super Arts and the EX-inspired
                canceling to create what is perhaps
                 the most perfectly paced and 
                 precision-based fighting system
                  ever seen.
                  <p>
         “While highly flawed in the first game
         , New Generations, [the parry system]
          was perfected by Third Strike, the third
           iteration of SFIII,” esports commentator
            James Chen says. “And honestly, its story
             of going from basically a flop in the U.S.
              to becoming one of the most beloved
               fighting games of all time here in the
                States is a long, long journey. […]
                 The parry mechanic remains as one of 
                 the most beloved and player-satisfying
                  mechanics ever created.”
         Though Street Fighter III didn’t revolutionize 
         fighting games like its numbered predecessor,
          it perfected the formula. But it was a gem 
          fans didn’t fully appreciate in its time. However
          , even as competing fighting game franchises 
          flourished under the new trend of 3D visuals and
           fight planes, the Street Fighter franchise entered
            the largest lull of its history, and fans 
            didn’t receive a new Street Fighter game for
             eight years.</p>

         Shmuplations has republished the
          first part of a 2003 interview with
           designer and illustrator Akira Yasuda 
           that runs through his career, from his
            first work as an artist and his later 
            design work with the Street Fighter
             and Final Fight games.
<p>
         During one part of the interview, Yasuda walks
          through how the team at Capcom pitched fighters
           for Street Fighter II. He talks about how some 
           of the more unusual Street Fighter characters 
           like Dhalsim, Blanka, and Vega were born out
            of an unspoken rule that encouraged them to
             push the boundaries of their designs: “It
              wasn’t good until it made us laugh.”

            Street Fighter relinquished its claim
             to the throne in the early years of the 
             new millennium. With more players looking 
             to enjoy a 3D experience, franchises like
              Tekken, Soulcalibur, and Dead or Alive
               stepped into the spotlight. Even Street
                Fighter’s closest rival, Mortal Kombat,
                 transitioned to 3D fighters. Despite
                  the EX spin-off series’ use of 3D
                  graphics, Street Fighter always 
                  remained steadfast in its 2D action.
                   The final EX entry landed on PlayStation 2
                    in 2000, giving fans nothing more 
                    than re-releases of Street Fighter
                     II and III on modern consoles in 
                     the succeeding years.
   
          <p>
            “People basically had forgotten about the genre,”
             Chen says. “While some franchises like Tekken 
             and Guilty Gear continued to create quality games
             , other franchises like Street Fighter disappeared 
             and Mortal Kombat had its notorious run of awful
              games during that period. Basically, in the U.S.,
               fighting games were a thing of the past.”
             However, as all its rivals trailblazed 3D 
             frontiers, Yoshinori Ono, whose work with 
             Capcom stretched back to the early ’90s, 
             noticed how many people clamored for a 
             new mainline entry.
            <p>
               Based on the reception to Street Fighter
                II on Xbox Live Arcade, he petitioned Capcom’s
                 Keiji Inafune to allow the team to create a
                  new mainline game inspired by Super Street 
                  Fighter II Turbo.
               Ono, who had previously worked as 
               a sound producer on the Alpha games,
                stepped into the producer role as he 
                tried to bring the series back to its 
                roots. The result was Street Fighter
                IV, a game that used modern visuals and
                 embellished 3D character models with 
                 ink-based flourishes instead of sprites.
                  The team maintained the tight, responsive
                  2D fighting action that made Street
                   Fighter so popular in the first place by
                    implementing 2D hitboxes over the 
                    3D character models.
